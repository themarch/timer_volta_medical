# My clock
    Hi ! This is my clock with a backend in python and a frontend in React !
     
    To start the servers, you need two terminals
  	  - In the first : "pip3 install websockets && cd back-end && python3 server.py"
      - In the second : "cd front-end && npm install && npm start"
  
  Enjoy :)
